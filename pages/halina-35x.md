Some more [info about the camera + specs](https://floggingenglish.com/photography/halina-35x-a-compact-35mm-film-camera/), and a [review with samples](https://oldcamera.blog/2014/06/17/halina-35x/)

Also I use a [KEKS KM02](https://www.kekscameras.com/kekskm02.html#/) in the fetching chrome colour as a cold-shoe light meter for the Halina since it doesn't have one built in.
