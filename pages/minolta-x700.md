I actually ended up buying my Minolta X-700 to get the Rokkor-X 45mm f/2 pancake lens that came attached to it, as it was cheaper to buy them together than to just buy the lens separately. Turns out the X-700 works great, and is a great travel camera as the Program mode makes it easier for non-photographer types to use.
